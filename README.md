# open-access-publishing-data
Small Java SE software application to create and persist POJOs from JSON (via open access web services) and XML data (local business information). The software replicates data from adjacent business systems (i.e. CRIS), external RESTful web services (e.g. OaDoi) and persists data in a MySQL database.
